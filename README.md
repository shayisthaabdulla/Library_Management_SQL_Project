# 📚 Library Management Database (SQL Project)

## 🧾 Project Overview

**Project Title:** Library Management Database  
**Level:** Beginner – Intermediate  
**Database:** `library_db` (PostgreSQL)  
**Tables:** librarians, students, books, book_issues, approvals, logs  
**Records per Table:** 1000+ rows

This SQL project simulates a real-world Library Management System that tracks student registrations, book issues, librarian approvals, and borrowing logs. It mirrors the kind of reporting, validation, and data insight work Business Analysts perform in operational and academic institutions.

## 🎯 Why This Project Matters

Libraries need proper systems to monitor inventory, prevent overdue issues, and track user activities. This project covers critical SQL skills such as:

- Data exploration and reporting  
- JOINs across multiple relational tables  
- Aggregation, grouping, and filtering  
- Data validation and anomaly detection  
- CASE logic and subqueries

The dataset mimics real-world scenarios where SQL is used to generate usage reports, analyze borrowing behavior, track overdue returns, and support librarian workflows.

## 🧩 Objectives

1. Create relational tables for books, students, librarians, and logs  
2. Simulate real-world operations like book issuance, return tracking, and approval workflows  
3. Perform real-life Business Analyst SQL tasks across 50+ query types  
4. Practice query writing for interviews and dashboards

## 🧱 Project Structure

**Database Setup**
**Database Name**: 'library_management'
Built using PostgreSQL 

**Table Creation**
Six core tables represent library management:

  - `librarians`: Stores librarian contact details
  - `students`: Registered students and their approval status
  - `books`: Catalog of available books with genres and stock count
  - `book_issues`: Transactions of issued/returned books
  - `approvals`: Manual approvals processed by librarians
  - `logs`: Record of book actions (issued/returned) by students

 ```sql
  -- Table: librarians

CREATE TABLE librarians (
    librarian_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE,
    password VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Table: students
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    registered_date DATE,
    approved_by INT
);

-- Table: books
CREATE TABLE books (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(100),
    genre VARCHAR(50),
    published_year INT,
    copies_available INT
);

-- Table: book_issues
CREATE TABLE book_issues (
    issue_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT REFERENCES students(student_id),
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(book_id),
    issue_date DATE,
    return_date DATE,
    returned BOOLEAN
);

-- Table: approvals
CREATE TABLE approvals (
    approval_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT REFERENCES students(student_id),
    approval_type VARCHAR(50),
    request_date DATE,
    status VARCHAR(20),
    processed_by INT REFERENCES librarians(librarian_id)
);

-- Table: logs
CREATE TABLE logs (
    log_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT REFERENCES students(student_id),
    book_id INT REFERENCES books(book_id),
    action VARCHAR(20),
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
);
```

## 🧮 SQL Query Categories

Each query is available in the [📄 `library_sql_queries.md`](https://github.com/shayisthaabdulla/Library_Management_SQL_Project/blob/main/library_sql_queries.md) file and tested against the PostgreSQL-compatible dataset.

## 📌 Sample Queries

✅ List all books in the 'Fiction' genre:
```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE genre = 'Fiction';
```

✅ Find overdue books not yet returned:
```sql
SELECT * FROM book_issues
WHERE return_date < CURRENT_DATE AND returned = 'false';
```

✅ Top 5 most issued books:
```sql
SELECT b.title, COUNT(*) AS times_issued
FROM book_issues bi
JOIN books b ON bi.book_id = b.book_id
GROUP BY b.title
ORDER BY times_issued DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

✅ Students with late returns (over 30 days):
```sql
SELECT s.student_id, s.name, b.return_date
FROM students s
JOIN book_issues b ON s.student_id = b.student_id
WHERE b.returned = 'true' AND b.return_date > b.issue_date + INTERVAL '30 days';
```

## 📂 Files Included

- `library_sql_queries.md` – Contains all 52 PostgreSQL queries grouped by category
- CSVs:
  - `books.csv`
  - `students.csv`
  - `librarians.csv`
  - `book_issues.csv`
  - `approvals.csv`
  - `logs.csv`
 
## 📊 Key Findings
- Fiction and Science are the most borrowed genres, while Philosophy and Drama see the least circulation.
- Over 15% of issued books were returned late; several students returned books more than 30 days past due.
- 10 students borrowed more than 8 books each, highlighting frequent borrowers.
- More than 20 book titles have fewer than 3 copies left, indicating stock replenishment needs.
- Librarian ID 3 processed the highest number of student approvals.
- Several approvals have missing or invalid statuses, suggesting potential workflow issues.
- About 18% of students registered on weekends, highlighting valuable weekend activity.
- At least 15% of books have never been issued; some students registered but never borrowed books.

## 📈 Suggested Reports
- **Monthly Book Issue Trends** – Visualize the number of books issued each month.
- **Top 10 Most Borrowed Books** – Identify books requiring restocking.
